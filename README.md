Set up Git repository: Create a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) to host your application code. Developers will push their code changes to this repository.

Set up Jenkins server: Install and configure Jenkins on a server or cloud instance. You'll need to install necessary plugins for Maven, SonarQube, Docker, and other integrations.

Configure Jenkins job: Create a Jenkins job that listens for changes in the Git repository (using webhooks or periodic polling). Configure the job to pull the code, build and test with Maven, and then execute static code analysis with SonarQube.

Set up Docker Hub account: Create an account on Docker Hub, which will be used as the container registry to store your Docker images.

Set up Trivy: Install and configure Trivy on your Jenkins server to scan Docker images for vulnerabilities.

Create Dockerfile: Write a Dockerfile for your application, specifying how to build the Docker image.

Configure Jenkins job for Docker: Add steps to your Jenkins job to build the Docker image using the Dockerfile and push it to Docker Hub.

Update build number: Configure Jenkins to update the build number in a file or environment variable. You can use plugins like EnvInject to achieve this.

Set up Argo CD: Install and configure Argo CD on your Kubernetes cluster. Configure it to watch the Git repository where Kubernetes manifests are stored.

Write Kubernetes manifests: Create Kubernetes manifests (YAML files) for deploying your application on EKS. These files define the resources required for your application, such as deployments, services, and ingresses.

Store manifests in Git repository: Store the Kubernetes manifests in the same Git repository as your application code.

Deploy with Argo CD: Once Argo CD detects changes in the Git repository, it will automatically deploy the application to the EKS cluster using the Kubernetes manifests.

Monitor pipeline: Set up monitoring and logging for your CI/CD pipeline to track the progress of builds and deployments, and to detect any issues.
